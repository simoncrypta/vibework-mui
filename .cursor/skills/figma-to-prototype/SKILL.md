  Turns Figma designs into Vibework prototypes using Figma MCP and RedwoodSDK

# Figma → Vibework prototype

Ship a clickable screen in this repo's stack. Prefer speed and your project's UI components over pixel-perfect custom CSS.

## Prerequisites

- Figma MCP available (`get_design_context`, `get_screenshot`, `get_metadata`)
- If tools are missing: ask the user to run `/add-plugin figma` or enable project MCP (`.cursor/mcp.json`)

## Workflow

### 1. Pull design context

From the Figma URL or selection:

1. `get_screenshot` — visual target
2. `get_design_context` — structure, text, layout, components
3. `get_metadata` / `get_variable_defs` only if tokens or naming matter

Do not implement from memory when a URL or node is available.

### 2. Map to UI components

Map Figma pieces to components from your design system (or plain HTML + Tailwind in this core template). Use Tailwind on wrappers for spacing and layout.

If using a Vibework variant (e.g. vibework-astryx, vibework-mui), follow that variant's component discovery workflow. For MUI, use [MUI docs](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/) and map Figma components to `@mui/material` primitives.

### 3. Implement in the app

| Concern                                    | Where                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Page / route shell                         | Server Component in `src/app/pages/`                        |
| Controlled inputs, toggles, local UI state | `"use client"` island under `src/app/components/`           |
| Theme / DS provider                        | `src/app/providers.tsx`                                     |
| Styles                                     | Tailwind `className`; avoid new global CSS unless necessary |

Patterns to copy:

- Server page + client form: `src/app/pages/home.tsx` + `src/app/components/hello-form.tsx`
- Client card: `src/app/components/info-card.tsx`

### 4. Wire the route

If this is a new screen, register it in `src/worker.tsx` with `route()`. Keep URLs simple for prototypes.

### 5. Verify

- `vp dev` if not already running
- `vp check` before calling the work done on non-trivial UI

## Rules of thumb

- One screen at a time unless the user asks for a full flow
- Use Tailwind spacing and typography utilities rather than hard-coded px/hex
- Skip auth, data layers, and tests unless the user asks
- Assets: use Figma MCP asset guidance; prefer remote URLs the MCP provides over checking in binaries

## Anti-patterns

- Marking the whole page `"use client"` for one form field
- Ignoring Figma MCP and freehanding the layout
- Adding new dependencies for a one-off prototype effect
